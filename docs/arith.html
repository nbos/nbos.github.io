        <p>I find that information theory, a core discipline of computer science,
is given relatively little attention in a computer science
degree. Although Hamming and Shannon are likely to be mentioned at some
point, the only attribution to the field I remember having to study were
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman trees</a>, which are
nice, but just one of the many approximations of the true entropy
encoding algorithm: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding">arithmetic
coding</a> (a.k.a. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_coding">range
coding</a>). It isn’t
particularly more complex, yet it holds more theoretical significance
because it always encodes messages to the theoretically minimum code
length (which is also just called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content"><em>information
content</em></a> of the
data) with respect to a probabilistic model.</p>
<p>Here is my take on an explanation.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-a-symbol">Encoding a Symbol</h2>
<p>Given an alphabet of symbols and a model of their probabilities, place
them in the manner of a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">CDF</a> of
a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution">categorical
distribution</a>:</p>
<p><img src="./images/cat-cdf.png" /></p>
<p>Now, the code for a symbol is simply the base expansion (for a given
base, here we use 2 for binary) of the fraction <span class="math inline">\(0 \le r \lt 1\)</span> whose
<strong>range</strong> (the interval between that number and its successor in the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place">ULP</a>) falls
entirely within the <strong>interval</strong> of the desired symbol. In practice, you
can split your space in however many equal parts of your base:</p>
<p><img src="./images/bin0.png" /></p>
<p>and continuously split until a code’s range falls well within the
interval of the symbol to encode:</p>
<p><img src="./images/bin2.png" /></p>
<p>For instance, the code <span style="color: red">101</span> above
(corresponding to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Fractions">binary
fractional</a>
0.<span style="color: red">101</span>) falls between both bounds of the
symbol <span style="color: blue"><strong>&amp;</strong></span>, then that terminates the
algorithm. The decoder will know what symbol was encoded by using the
same distribution and finding the symbol whose interval the number falls
under.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-a-message">Encoding a Message</h2>
<p>The beauty of arithmetic coding is the optimality you get by recursively
applying the above principle for each symbol inside the interval of the
previous symbol. It’s best explained graphically:</p>
<p><img src="./images/arith-que.png" /></p>
<p>By nesting distributions within each other, every string of symbols
(however long) corresponds to an interval (however small) and a code. An
effective arithmetic coding algorithm continuously “zooms” into the 0-1
interval, maintaining good precision and producing 0s and 1s (or
symbols, when decoding) depending on where it “goes”.</p>
<h2 id="adaptive-coding">Adaptive Coding</h2>
<p>Smart models update their probabilities given previous observations,
which directly translates in better (shorter) codes in arithmetic
coding. For instance, instead of a single categorical distribution like
we’ve been using so far based on the relative frequencies of letters in
English, you get much better probabilities for English strings by
considering the probabilities of symbols <em>given</em> the previous symbol,
i.e. a <strong>conditional</strong> (or equivalently a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram">bigram</a> model). Furthermore a
3-gram model would model English even better and so on…</p>
<p>For instance, even though <strong>Q</strong> is a relatively rare letter in English
(and therefore its unconditional code relatively long), it is almost
always followed by a <span style="color: blue"><strong>U</strong></span>, in which
case, it is almost always followed by a vowel, so given a code for <strong>Q</strong>
and a good conditional model, the code for <strong>Q<span style="color:
blue">U</span><span style="color:
#00EF19">E</span></strong> would not be much longer because it takes a significant
amount of space within <strong>Q</strong>’s interval:</p>
<p><img src="./images/cond-que.png" /></p>
<p>For longer messages, it plays out a bit like the game-like accessibility
input method <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasher_(software)">Dasher</a>,
which lets a user enter text by navigating the nested space of symbols
with a mouse when using a keyboard is not convenient. The program uses a
language model that scales the relative sizes of the intervals depending
on their probability. (Here is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr3s4613DX8">longer
version</a> if you liked
that).</p>
<p><img src="./images/dasher.gif" /></p>
<h2 id="code-length">Code Length</h2>
<p>The geometric representation of probability works especially because it
stays consistent across levels: “inserting” a probability distribution
within a symbol’s interval has the same effect as scaling it by the
probability of that symbol. Ultimately, the probability of a message is
the product of the probabilities of all its symbols (i.e. the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_(probability)">chain
rule</a>) and is
equal to the width it takes on the original unit space:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\texttt{&quot;Hello&quot;}) = P(\texttt{&quot;H&quot;})
	\cdot P(\texttt{&quot;e&quot;} | \texttt{&quot;H&quot;})
	\cdot P(\texttt{&quot;l&quot;} | \texttt{&quot;He&quot;})\\
	\cdot P(\texttt{&quot;l&quot;} | \texttt{&quot;Hel&quot;})
	\cdot P(\texttt{&quot;o&quot;} | \texttt{&quot;Hell&quot;})\]</span></p>
<p>Since a code scales the working range with each additional bit, the
<strong>length of the code</strong> for a message is the number of times the unit
space has to be halved in order to fit in the message’s interval, or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L(\texttt{&quot;Hello&quot;}) = \left\lceil\log_{\frac{1}{2}}(P(\texttt{&quot;Hello&quot;}))\right\rceil\]</span></p>
<p>which is just a rounded up version of the more usual representation of
<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content">information
content</a></strong> (in bits):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}I(A) &amp;= -\log_{2}(P(A))\\
I(\texttt{&quot;Hello&quot;}) &amp;= -\log_{2}(P(\texttt{&quot;Hello&quot;}))\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>and since the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms, we
get the information theoretic “chain rule” where the information of a
message is the sum of the information of the symbols, which makes sense
as the length of a code for e.g. a fixed width or bit-aligned coding
scheme is the sum of the lengths of the codes of the symbols.</p>
<p>Finally, this gives us the intuition for why arithmetic encoding is
<strong>optimal</strong> compared to a bit-aligned code like Huffman codes. Since in
a Huffman tree symbols get assigned a constant code, the best it can
provide is codes for symbols as long as their individual information
content rounded up. So the length of a whole message would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_\textrm{Huff}(A) = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left\lceil I \left(A_{k}\,{\Bigg |}\,\bigcap_{j=1}^{k-1}A_{j}\right)\right\rceil\]</span></p>
<p>Whereas arithmetic coding only has to round at the last bit:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_\textrm{Arith}(A) = \left\lceil\sum_{k=1}^{n} I \left(A_{k}\,{\Bigg |}\,\bigcap_{j=1}^{k-1}A_{j}\right)\right\rceil\]</span></p>
<p>So in general, <span class="math display">\[L_\textrm{Arith}(A) \le L_\textrm{Huff}(A)\]</span> and they
are only ever equal when <em>all</em> the relative probabilities in the model
happen to be exact multiples of the base e.g. (0.5, 0.25, 0.125,
etc. for binary).</p>
<h2 id="eom">EOM</h2>
<p>A caveat to the above length calculations is that some strings could be
un-encodable if the probability of any symbol after the last happens to
be more than <span class="math inline">\(1/\)</span>base, as the working range might drop within the
interval of further nested symbols after encoding the last symbol
without adding more code, leading to a code corresponding to more than
one possible message.</p>
<p>The fail-safe solution to this, typically included in specifications of
arithmetic encoding, is either to add an
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_message">EOM</a> symbol that signals
the end of the string or prepend some <strong>fixed-length size parameter</strong>
and have the decoding algorithm count to know when to stop decoding.</p>
<p>In either method, the added length to the code is on the order of
<span class="math inline">\(\log(L)\)</span> which is usually insignificant compared to <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> unless when
encoding very small messages.</p>
